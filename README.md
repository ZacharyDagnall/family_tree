# What's next?
### after adding a new relationship, the redirect should depend on where you just came from!
### when you delete a person, it has to delete all of their relationships too
### add methods for siblings, aunts uncles
### conditional displays (if they are married, no husband/wife option)
### sex to tell whether husband or wife?
### better use of macros

## home page - should have multiple different families to click on, and each links you to the family tree for that family
#### but how do i determine the "top" of a family tree ??

## future:
* a user should be able to log-in and edit their own family info (it takes them to the show page for their own name upon login)
* they can view (but not edit) all _other_ families when logged in
* they can view all families when not logged in
